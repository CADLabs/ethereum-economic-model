    "The purpose of this notebook is to recreate selected scenario analyses from the (widely acknowledged) [Hoban/Borgers Ethereum 2.0 Economic Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y18MoYSBLlHZ-ueN9m0a-JpC6tYjqDtpISJ6_WdicdE) using the CADLabs model, and to compare the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis 1, \"Profit Yields Across Validator Environments\"**, plots the average profitability of validators across different validator environments in two different adoption (i.e. total ETH staked) scenarios and a wide range of ETH prices. A description of the different validator environments and respective assumptions can be found in the [assumptions document](../../ASSUMPTIONS.md). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis 2, \"Network Yields and Network Inflation\"**, combines the simulation of average (i.e. not validator-environment specific) Revenue Yields, Profit Yields (across two illustrative ETH price levels), with the associated overall network inflation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis 3, \"Revenue/Profit Yield Spread \"Three Region Analysis\"\"**, compares the spread between average (i.e. not validator-environment specific) Revenue Yields and Profit Yields across a wide range of ETH prices, and across the two adoption scenarios seen earlier in this notebook.\n",

    "# Experiment Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model adopts a range of assumptions from the Hoban/Borgers Ethereum 2.0 Economic Model (notably all validator cost assumptions across validator environments).\n",
    "However, because the Hoban/Borgers Model was published pre-Altair and the CADLabs model post-Altair, some assumptions differ slightly (notably validator incentive parameters, and rewards such as the new sync committee reward). Hence, rather than a perfect match of simulation results, we expect a very close match, which will serve the purpose of a sanity check.\n",

    "The below plots recreate Hoban/Borgers' analysis. The Revenue/Profit Yield Spread for our model closely matches the [Hoban/Borgers Ethereum 2.0 Economic Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y18MoYSBLlHZ-ueN9m0a-JpC6tYjqDtpISJ6_WdicdE) for both scenarios. We can conclude that the model is valid for this specific scenario analysis."
