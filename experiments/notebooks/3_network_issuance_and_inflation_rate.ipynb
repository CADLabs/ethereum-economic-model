    "This analysis enables the exploration of the inflation rate and ETH supply over time, and supports the three adoption scenarios introduced in the second experiment notebook, as well as custom parameter choices for the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Activation Date (\"The Merge\") and EIP-1559 Base Fee.\n",

    "Default scenarios were selected for each of the Validator Adoption, Proof-of-Stake Activation Date, and EIP-1559 categories:\n",
    "* Validator Adoption (as seen in Notebook \"Validator Revenue and Profit Yields\")\n",
    "    * Normal adoption: assumes an average of 3 new validators per epoch. These rates correspond to the historical average newly **activated** validators per epoch between 15 January 2021 and 15 July 2021 as per [Beaconscan](https://beaconscan.com/stat/validator).\n",
    "    * Low adoption: assumes an average of 1.5 new validators per epoch, i.e. a 50% lower rate compared to the base scenario\n",
    "    * High adoption: assumes an average of 4.5 new validators per epoch, i.e. a 50% higher rate compared to the base scenario\n",
    "* Proof-of-Stake Activation Date\n",
    "    * Scenarios starting from 1 Decemeber 2021 in quarterly increments \n",

This allows comparative analysis for each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can interpret that:\n",
    "* Increased Validator Adoption (i.e. implied ETH staked over time) results in higher inflation due to increased issuance for validator rewards\n",
    "* A delay in the Proof-of-Stake Activation Date results in a higher peak ETH supply due to Proof-of-Work issuance being significantly higher than that of Proof-of-Stake\n",
    "* EIP-1559 burns the base fee, which in certain conditions results in a deflationary ETH supply\n",
    "\n",
    "The second chart (\"Inflation Rate and ETH Supply Over Time\") depicts the historical inflation rate and ETH supply over time alongside the simulated projections of the inflation rate and ETH supply. Various historical and simulated milestones are included for context, such as the \"Homestead\" hard-fork causing a temporary increase in the inflation rate, or the simulated effect of EIP-1559 being enabled and Proof-of-Stake being activated. The interface allows us to both select the default scenarios defined above, or customize each parameter for unique analyses."
