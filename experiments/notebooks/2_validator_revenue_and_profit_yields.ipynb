    "\n",
    "This analysis allows the exploration of revenue and profit yields over time, and across three linear adoption scenarios (historical adoption has been approximately linear):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Normal adoption: assumes an average of 3 new validators per epoch. These rates correspond to the historical average newly **activated** validators per epoch between 15 January 2021 and 15 July 2021 as per [Beaconscan](https://beaconscan.com/stat/validator).\n",
    "* Low adoption: assumes an average of 1.5 new validators per epoch, i.e. a 50% lower rate compared to the base scenario\n",
    "* High adoption: assumes an average of 4.5 new validators per epoch, i.e. a 50% higher rate compared to the base scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Adoption scenarios can be customized by updating the `validator_process` System Parameter if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first chart (\"Validator Adoption Scenarios\") depicts the three adoption scenarios (i.e. implied ETH staked over time) underlying Analysis 1. Please note that the High Adoption Scenario has non-linear dynamics due to the validator-activation queue-rate limiting. To create custom adoption scenarios, add another entry to the `validator_process` System Parameter, with either a static per-epoch validator adoption rate, or generate a time-series using the current timestep to index the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second chart (\"Revenue and Profit Yields Over Time – At a Glance\") depicts both revenue and profit yields over time and across the three adoption scenarios (i.e. implied ETH staked over time). The ETH price (relevant for profit yields) is by default set to the mean ETH price over the last 12 months. The higher the adoption, the lower both revenue and profit yields. The higher the ETH price, the higher the profit yields; while validator operational costs are fixed in dollars, returns are in ETH and their equivalent dollar value depends on the current ETH price.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third chart (\"Revenue or Profit Yields Over Time\") depicts revenue yields or profit yields (choose using button selector) over the chosen time frame and across the three adoption scenarios  (i.e. implied ETH staked over time), and ETH price range. In simple terms, this chart depicts how validators can expect the yield dynamics to change over different adoption and price scenarios. The higher the adoption, the lower both revenue and profit yields. The higher the price, the higher the profit yields.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth chart (\"Cumulative Revenue or Profit Yields Over Time\") depicts the cumulative revenue yields or profit yields (choose via button selector) over the chosen time frame, and across the three adoption scenarios (i.e. implied ETH staked over time) and ETH price range. In simple terms, this chart depicts the effective yields a validator can expect over the respective time horizons if they start validating today. The higher the adoption, the lower both revenue and profit yields. The higher the price, the higher the profit yields."
