    "The experiment architecture is composed of the following four elements – the **model**, **default experiment**, **experiment templates**, and **experiment notebooks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **model** is initialized with a default Initial State and set of System Parameters defined in the `model` module.\n",
    "2. The **default experiment** – in the `experiments.default_experiment` module – is an experiment composed of a single simulation that uses the default cadCAD **model** Initial State and System Parameters. Additional default simulation execution settings such as the number of timesteps and runs are also set in the **default experiment**.\n",
    "3. The **experiment templates** – in the `experiments.templates` module – contain pre-configured analyses based on the **default experiment**. Examples include `experiments.templates.time_domain_analysis` (simulation in the time-domain over a period of 5 years) and `experiments.templates.eth_price_sweep_analysis` (simulation in the phase-space sweeping over discrete ETH Price values).\n",
    "4. The **experiment notebooks** perform various scenario analyses by importing existing **experiment templates**, optionally modifying the Initial State and System Parameters within the notebook, and then executing them."
