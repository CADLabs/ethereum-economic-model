## Context

This open-source model has been developed in collaboration with the Ethereum Robust Incentives Group, funded by the Ethereum Foundation Eth2 Staking Community Grants program. While originally scoped with purely modeling-educational intent as part of the cadCAD Edu online course "[cadCAD Masterclass: Ethereum Validator Economics](https://www.cadcad.education/course/masterclass-ethereum), it has evolved to become a highly versatile, customizable and extensible research tool, and includes a list of [model extension ideas](#roadmap). The model is focused on epoch- and population-level Ethereum validator economics across different deployment types and - at least in its initial setup - abstracts from slot- and agent-level dynamics. Please see [model assumptions] (assumptions.md) for further further context.

## Model Features

* Configurable to reflect protocol behavior at different points in time of the development roadmap (referred to as "upgrade stages" in this model):
  * post Beacon Chain launch, pre EIP1559, pre PoS (validators receive PoS incentives, EIP1559 disabled, and PoW still in operation)
  * post Beacon Chain launch, post EIP1559, pre PoS (validators receive PoS incentives, EIP1559 enabled with miners receiving tips, and PoW still in operation)
  * post Beacon Chain launch, post EIP1559, post PoS (validators receive PoS incentives, EIP1559 enabled with validators receiving tips, and PoW deprecated)
* Supports [state space analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-space_representation) (i.e. simulation of system behavior over time) and [phase space analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space) (i.e. generation of all unique system states in a given experimental setup)
* Customizable processes to set important variables such as ETH price, ETH staked, EIP1559 transaction pricing, and transaction rates
* Modular model structure for convenient extension and modification. This allows different user groups to refactor the model for different purposes, rapidly test new incentive mechanisms, or to update the model as Ethereum implements new protocol improvements.
* References to official [Eth2 specs](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs) in Policy and State Update Function logic. This enables seamless onboarding of protocol developers or for the more advanced cadCAD user to dig into the underlying protocol design that inspired the logic.

## Model Architecture

The [model/](model/) directory contains the model's software architecture in the form of two categories of modules: structural modules and configuration modules.

### Structural Modules

The model is composed of several structural modules in the [model/parts/](model/parts/) directory:

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ethereum_system.py](model/parts/ethereum_system.py) | Genereal Ethereum mechanisms, such as managing the system upgrade process, the EIP1559 transaction pricing mechanism, and updating the ETH price and ETH supply |
| [pos_incentives.py](model/parts/pos_incentives.py) | Proof of Stake incentives |
| [system_metrics.py](model/parts/system_metrics.py) | Calculation of validator costs, revenue, profit, and yield metrics |
| [validators.py](model/parts/validators.py) | Validator processes such as validator activation, staking, uptime |
| [utils/ethereum_spec.py](model/parts/utils/ethereum_spec.py) | Relevant extracts from the official Eth2 spec |

### Configuration Modules

The model is configured using several configuration modules in the [model/](model/) directory:

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [constants.py](model/constants.py) | Constants used in the model e.g. number of epochs in a year, Gwei in 1 Ether |
| [simulation_configuration.py](model/simulation_configuration.py) | Simulation configuration such as the number of timesteps and Monte Carlo runs |
| [state_update_blocks.py](model/state_update_blocks.py) | cadCAD model state update block structure, composed of Policy and State Update Functions |
| [state_variables.py](model/state_variables.py) | Model State Variable definition, configuration, and defaults |
| [stochastic_processes.py](model/stochastic_processes.py) | Helper functions to generate stochastic environmental processes |
| [system_parameters.py](model/system_parameters.py) | Model System Parameter definition, configuration, and defaults |
| [types.py](model/types.py) | Various Python types used in the model, such as the `Stage` Enum and calculation units |
| [utils.py](model/utils.py) | Misc. utility and helper functions |

## Running Experiments

The [experiments/](experiments/) directory contains modules for configuring and executing simulation experiments, as well as performing post-processing of the results.

The [experiments/templates/](experiments/templates/) directory contains different experiment templates which are used in the Jupyter experiment notebooks in the [notebooks/](experiments/notebooks/) directory to answer research questions and perform scenario analyses.

See the [notebooks/README.ipynb](experiments/notebooks/0_README.ipynb) notebook for a walk-through of how to configure and execute an experiment.

We created several experiment notebooks as a basis for analyzing the economics Ethereum validators are confronted with under a variety of scenarios. These notebooks and analysis don't aim to comprehensively illuminate the Ethereum protocol, but rather to answer the most salient questions and serve as inspiration for building out more customized analysis and model extensions.

### 1. Model Validation

The purpose of this notebook is to recreate selected simulations from the widely acknowledged Hoban/Borgers Ethereum 2.0 Economic Model using the CADLabs model, and to compare the results. We suggest that the CADLabs model has a high degree of validity.

### 2. Validator Revenue and Profit Yields (Validator-level Analysis)

The purpose of this notebook is to explore the returns validators can expect from staking in the Ethereum protocol across different time horizons, adoption scenarios, ETH price scenarios and validator environments.

* Analysis 1: Revenue and Profit Yields Over Time
* Analysis 2: Revenue and Profit Yields Over ETH Staked
* Analysis 3: Revenue and Profit Yields Over ETH Price
* Analysis 4: Profit Yields Over ETH Staked vs. ETH Price (Yield Surface)
* Analysis 5: Profit Yields By Validator Environment Over Time

### 3. Network Issuance and Inflation Rate (Network-level Analysis)

The purpose of this notebook is to explore the ETH issuance and resulting annualized inflation rate across different time horizons and adoption scenarios. It includes a breakdown of issuance into reward types , the well-known "Ultrasound Monday" (peak ETH) analysis by Just Drake, and an analyis of the inflation impact of EIP1559. 

TODO: Draft analysis, below first cut

* Analysis 1: TBC, let's define once the previous notebook is done
* Analysis 2: TBC, let's define once the previous notebook is done
* Analysis 3: TBC, let's define once the previous notebook is done

### 4. Other Analysis

The purpose of this notebook is to provide inspiration for other analysis that the model supports. Most of these analyses are in a work-in-progress and marked as such. 

### Experiment Execution

The default experiment is an experiment that uses the default cadCAD System Parameters, Initial State, and State Update Blocks defined in the [models/](models/) directory.

To run the default experiment from the terminal, execute the `experiments.run` module:
```bash
python3 -m experiments.run
```

Alternatively, open and run one of the Jupyter experiment notebooks in Jupyter Lab or Notebook.

### Experiment Workflow

1. Choose or create a new experiment template in the [experiments/templates/](experiments/templates/) directory
2. Copy the template experiment from [experiments/template.py](experiments/templates/__init__.py) into the directory
3. Customize the default experiment using the template
4. Create a new Jupyter experiment notebook using the [notebooks/template.ipynb](experiments/notebooks/template.ipynb) experiment notebook template
5. Execute your experiment, post-process and analyze the results, and create Plotly charts!

## Roadmap

The following is a non-exhaustive list of possible model extensions and future features:
* Implement the ability to simulate an inactivity leak scenario
* Implement a dynamic EIP1559 basefee with a feedback loop based on blockspace demand / network congestion
* Backtest the model against historical data such as the ETH price, ETH staked to determine expected historical yields
* Extend the model to cover future Ethereum upgrade stages after merge, such as sharding
* Apply Hoban/Borgers security (cost of attack) and required rate of return (RSAVY) analysis to simulation results
* ...
